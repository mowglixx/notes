## Vibe Check

### How do you feel today?
Well, not bad, not good, nervous about Thursday

### What would make you happy today?
Sorting Easter Eggs out for the kids

## Today's Goals
Do a minimum of 4 things from top to lowest priority with a time estimate

- Get Easter Eggs for Ryan and Nathan from gran and us
- Test Fedora for steam gaming
- read through task for MV interview (see [Multiverse - Tech Programme Coach (Launch Coach)](../../../Job%20Seeking/Applications/Multiverse%20-%20Tech%20Programme%20Coach%20(Launch%20Coach).md))
	- look for: 
		- tricky wording
		- unknowns
	- Check email for:
		- Attachments
		- Interview structure
- Develop portfolio in HTML and CSS
	- I'm getting in my own way with this one, I'm rolling out badly implemented large scale code and making the task worse than it could be, react is cool and all but it helps to have functional styles to throw onto working logic, if I have my "components" pre-built I can work faster in react, less time reading docs for front-end.

## Today's Opportunities
- Opp to do something nice for family
- Opp to prepare somewhat for the interview next week

## Today's Blockers
Laziness, oversleeping.

## Todays Outcome
REPLACEME
