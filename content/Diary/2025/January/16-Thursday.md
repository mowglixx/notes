# Whats going on?

JCP have asked me to look for work, the avenues that I'm currently comfortable with pursuing are jobs that I've already worked with a collection of my skills being utilised, in addition to this, I'd like to upskill to potentially transition from Software Dev to DevOps

## Options
I have a few options included but not limited to:
- [Skills Bootcamps](../Jobseeking/Training/Skills%20Bootcamps-1.md)
