## Premise
After my commitments review with [^1]JCP on 27/03/2025 (see [Work plan](../../../../Commitments/Work%20plan.md)), I thought it wise to reach out to an old manager/friend Andy B on 09/04/2025. 

My timing was impeccable as Multiverse has started hiring, he talked me through a few options and gave me a run-down of the roles I'd be suitable for, after which he asked me for a CV to attach to the application. 

There was another role but it has not been made available to apply for yet... more information promised as Andy has said that he'll need to ask about it more and get back to me.
## Outcome
The following day (10/04/2025) I received an email from Rubi B at [^2]MV saying the following
