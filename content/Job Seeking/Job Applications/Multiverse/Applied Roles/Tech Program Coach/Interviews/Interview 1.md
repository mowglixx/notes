## Details
The first interview at Multiverse was a simple face to face with a member of the Talent team, it was more relaxed to what I expected. 

I'm glad I was comfortable in the interview and didn't feel as if I overshared or got too chatty.

### Knowledge from interview
- The salary is from £45k/y **not** £42k/y
- The interview process is three stages, not like in the video from the last email

## Outcome
I have been able to secure the next stage of interview and am due to attend 24/04/2025 13.00-14.00
