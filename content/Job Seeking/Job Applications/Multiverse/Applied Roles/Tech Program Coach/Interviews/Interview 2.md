## Tasks

### Task One

At day 35 of an Apprentice’s journey, all Apprentices on programme are evaluated for success on programme. As part of your role, you will be responsible for identifying how likely an Apprentice is to complete the programme they are on in a timely manner.

This data includes observations from Welcome Meetings (also known as Launch Meetings), attendance and our own internal machine learning risk model. This culminates in a final traffic light system where green level means no issue found, amber being some risk and red being high risk.

#### Your task
Investigate the data provided and identify which of the Apprentices require extra attention Launch Coach - Take Home Task Data not included in notes
- Bucket the apprentices into the following categories:
	- **Non-start**
	- **Discussion with apprentice and manager to create an action plan to bring up to speed**
	- **Refer to specialist team (Functional Skills/Additional Learning Team/Tutors)**
	- **Continue as normal**
- Prepare a **10 minute** presentation to share your findings, showing your thought processes and the whys behind your decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> we do not expect you to go through each individual apprentice in this exercise, it is up to you to determine who is significant to bring up due to the actions you need to take.

### Task Two

**This part of the interview will be an in-interview exercise: a role play.** One of the interviewers will serve as an ‘acting Apprentice’. 

Use the information below to prepare for the role play. 

You are meeting with an Apprentice who has sent the following email after they have had their Launch Meeting (welcome to programme):

> 
> Dear Coach,
> 
> Thank you so much for your time so far. 
> 
> After thinking through what was shared about the programme, I would like to ask to withdraw from the programme. 
> 
> Whilst I would love the chance to learn the new skills, I do not think I would have the time to dedicate to the programme with my work at the moment.
> 
> Joe
> 

You have the following information about this Apprentice:
- They have attended all sessions to this point and they have completed 89% of the required work (also known as OTJ (on-the-job))
- They work for a healthcare client that has their busy time of year in the winter. The client is very invested in people remaining on the programme
- Joe has been in his role for 2 years and is in an Individual Contributor role in the Data Analytics team
- The apprentice’s Manager arrived late to the Launch meeting but was fully engaged when in the room and was excited about the opportunity for Joe. They were not CC’d on the email
- They shared no role fit concerns in the Launch Meeting but did express some worries about time management

How would you coach this apprentice to convince them to stay on the programme?

#### Intended Effort
Please spend no longer than 1-2 hours in total preparing for this task.
