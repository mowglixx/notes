## WHAT: Multiverse
==Technology and AI has radically transformed how the world works, creating the need for a new set of skills in the workplace. But, the current transition from education to work is both economically inefficient and socially unfair. We want to change that.==

We deliver a new kind of apprenticeship by harnessing the best of **human-centred coaching**, technology and AI. ***It’s a new approach to learning that’s measured, applied, guided and equitable.***

We find, train and support talented individuals, wherever they are in their career journey. We equip them with the in-demand AI, tech, software engineering and data skills to transform their careers, helping our customers close their most critical skill gaps.
