## Our Multiverse Values
Our company values were formed by our Founder and CEO, Euan Blair, and are reflective of his personal belief system and the values that he holds himself to. Additionally, it was important for the values to reflect our core beliefs as an organisation and our wider leadership team. Values are so important for us as they define not only who we are, but how we work and make decisions.
