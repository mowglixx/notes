# Welcome to My Notes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write [this repo](https://github.com/mowglixx/notes) and use Quartz to publish to GitHub Pages feel free to read on GitHub.

## Who is this for?

Anybody that would like to know what I'm up to, this could be friends checking in in or professionals looking to further their knowledge in an unfamiliar landscape, this will be the journal that ~~finally~~ persists.
