## Quick note on this site
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write markdown in [this repo](https://github.com/mowglixx/notes) and use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to publish to GitHub Pages feel free to read on GitHub.

If a link is broken for this site, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mowglixx/notes/issues/new?title=Link+not+working+on+quartz)

## Who is this for?

Anybody that would like to know what I'm up to, this could be friends checking in in or professionals looking to further their knowledge in an unfamiliar landscape, this will be the journal that ~~finally~~ persists... maybe, sometimes... if i feel like it...
