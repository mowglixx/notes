**Role: Tech Programme Coach**

We’re on a mission to provide equitable access to economic opportunity, for everyone.

We close critical skill gaps in the workforce through a new kind of apprenticeship that combines work and learning. We begin by recognizing high-potential individuals both inside and outside of a company's current workforce and then we create applied, guided and equitable learning programs, with measurable impact. Because we believe the world needs a better way to match its potential.

We work with over 1,500 leading companies including the likes of Microsoft, Citi and Just Eat to help solve their business-critical problems, and we’ve trained over 16,000 professional apprentices in the tech and data skills of the future. This is made possible by our global team who are driven to achieve a mission that matters, together.

Join Multiverse and help us set a new course for work.

**The Opportunity**

As a Technical Programme Coach (also known as Launch Coach), you will guide apprentices across multiple clients through the crucial first 60 days (Launch) of their programme, setting them up for success so they can reach their full potential.

Before a learner’s first day of learning at Multiverse, you will partner with our Implementation team (Go-to-market, Implementation and Admissions) to understand the value the learner and the client want to actualise on the programme, and you will be responsible for driving this in the first 60 days.

You will partner with an instructor on the initial programme kick-off meeting, called ‘Flying Start’ at Multiverse. You will guide learners through their launch meetings, setting up the framework for their learning and coaching to get the best out of any workshops and project planning that falls into the first 60 days. You will also assess and monitor apprentice behaviour within their first 60 days, taking decisive action to identify at-risk learners before day 42. Through testing, iteration, early intervention and an eye on any withdrawals where necessary, you'll help maintain program quality standards and protect both financial and reputational outcomes.

**What You'll Do**

- Confidently guiding large groups of apprentices through their exciting first 60 days on their programme with Multiverse and ensuring they are set up for success on all levels, helping their understanding of applying their acquired skills to their job roles.
    
- Organise a seamless handover after the first 60 days to the learner’s Cohort Coach to ensure a high-quality learner experience.
    
- Create a vibrant, inclusive, motivating environment that drives apprentice learning, engagement, and satisfaction.
    
- Master group and individualised coaching techniques to enhance apprentice learning.
    
- Adhere to the Coach Quality framework to ensure a consistent level of quality for every session and a consistent experience for every apprentice.
    
- Maintain an owner mentality, whether assigned a learner or in support of other coaches, being proactive in taking action, sharing feedback, or providing support to ensure the progress and success of learners.
    
- Work with your apprentices’ managers to understand the client's needs while ensuring apprentices are coached towards lasting success within the business.
    
- Consider learners who may wish to withdraw from the programme whilst keeping an eye on commercial success. Work closely with your manager to move the learner past the 42-day mark to decide on non-starts based on factors from our risk model. Consult with wider stakeholders to ensure preventable ‘non-starts’. Master objection handling and prepare for ‘crucial conversations’; be confident that any ‘non-starts’ have been supported fully by Multiverse.
    
- Ensure the experience of the first 60 days at Multiverse is continually reviewed, assessed and iterated to provide the best possible learner experience with a data-driven approach.
    
- Focus on results related to the programme health of your apprentices, implementing interventions in partnership with operations and sales team members to ensure learners stay on track, standing the best chance of success on our programmes.
    
- Utilise resources and learning opportunities provided by Multiverse to stay up-to-date on your knowledge, learning and product updates to ensure you are equipped to support your apprentices.
    
- Build and maintain credibility with your apprentices by utilising a mixture of professional experience, program/domain/industry knowledge and client context in your interactions.
    
- Create and use with confidence a compelling narrative about Multiverse, our mission, our programmes and the pillars of our offering, and help apprentices connect to it throughout their apprenticeship and beyond.
